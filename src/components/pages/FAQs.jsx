Services are available for adolescents and adults.' },
    { question: 'What services do you offer?', answer: 'We offer therapy and counseling, psychiatric medication management, comprehensive psychiatric assessments, ADHD and autism assessments, genetic testing, Spravato® treatments, telehealth, and RPM-enabled follow-up care.' },
    { question: 'Do you accept insurance?', answer: 'Yes—many major plans are accepted. Coverage depends on your specific plan and benefits; contact our team or your insurer to verify coverage for psychiatry and telehealth.' },
    { question: 'How do I get started?', answer: 'Begin with the secure online intake on our Start page. After we review your intake, our team will contact you to schedule a consultation and recommend next steps.' },

    { question: 'Do you offer telehealth visits and are they secure?', answer: 'Yes—telehealth visits are supported and delivered over secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms. You must be located in a state where the provider is licensed at the time of the appointment.' },
    { question: 'What is Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)?', answer: 'RPM uses connected devices to transmit vitals like blood pressure to your care team between visits, which helps safety monitoring and measurement-based medication adjustments.' },
    { question: 'How long do evaluations and testing take (ADHD, autism, genetic testing)?', answer: 'Timing varies: initial clinical assessments often take 60–90 minutes. ADHD/autism testing and comprehensive assessments may take additional sessions and standardized testing; genetic test results typically return in 1–3 weeks depending on the lab.' },

    { question: 'Is my information confidential?', answer: 'Yes. We use secure systems and follow HIPAA requirements to protect your health information.' },
    { question: 'What if I have an emergency?', answer: 'If you are in immediate danger or a medical emergency, call 911. For psychiatric crisis support, call or text 988. Our services are not a replacement for emergency care.' },
    { question: 'How do I know which therapy is right for me?', answer: 'Your clinician will work with you to select evidence-based modalities (CBT, ERP, DBT-informed skills) based on diagnosis, preferences, and goals.' },
    { question: 'Are evaluations available for adults?', answer: 'Yes. We perform assessments for adults and adolescents across neurodevelopmental and mood/anxiety presentations.' },
    { question: 'How often will I have appointments for medication management?', answer: 'Follow-up frequency depends on clinical need—initially more frequent (weeks) while stabilizing, then typically every 1–3 months for maintenance.' },
    { question: 'How is genetic testing collected and how long do results take?', answer: 'Genetic testing is usually a cheek swab or blood sample; results return per the lab timeline (commonly 1–3 weeks).' },
    { question: 'What if I need a higher level of care?', answer: 'If you need detox, inpatient care, or urgent stabilization, we will help coordinate a safe transfer to an appropriate setting.' },
