                            <p>Before using our service, it’s important to make sure you understand how Oasis Behavioral Health services work, including how Telehealth Care differs from visiting a more traditional outpatient office, the risks associated with medications, and participating in the therapy. If you have any questions, please send us a message at support@oasishealthservices.com</p>
                            <p>This service is provided by Oasis Health Services, LLC. Oasis Behavioral Health Services PROVIDES BEHAVIORAL CARE THROUGHOUT VARIOUS STATES. OBHS can store a request for psychotropic medications and/or therapy services and assign your appointment request to a licensed therapist or psychiatric nurse practitioner, as applicable, in your state, as long as it is included as one of the “States Where We Operate” as defined in the Terms of Use. After you request through our website, OBHS staff will nominate one or more of our clinicians such as NP and/or therapists, as applicable, in your state to work on your request and provide care to you.</p>

                                <p>I understand that OBHS does not offer emergency or crisis visits. I understand that, in an emergency, I should dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency department.</p>
                                <p>I understand that 24-hour help is available through the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK.</p>

                                <p>I understand that OBHS offers mental health services to clients in various states. I understand that telehealth is the use of electronic information and communication technologies by a healthcare provider to deliver services to an individual when he/she is located at a different site than the provider, and hereby consent that Oasis Behavioral Health Services (OBHS) provides health care services to me via telehealth.</p>
                                <p>I understand that telehealth involves the delivery of healthcare services using electronic communications, information technology, or other means between a healthcare provider and patients who are not in the same physical location.</p>
                                <p>I understand that this means that a provider is unable to conduct certain tests or assess vital signs in person, which may in some cases prevent the provider(s) from providing a diagnosis or treatment or from identifying the need for emergency medical care or treatment for me. I understand that OBHS offers Patient Remote Monitoring Program, otherwise, you must purchase your own Blood Pressure monitor and scale.</p>
                                <p>I understand that while the use of telehealth may provide potential benefits to me, as with any healthcare service, no such benefits or specific results can be guaranteed. My condition may not be cured or improved, and in some cases, may get worse.</p>

I understand that requesting treatment (by completing the intake questionnaire, conducting a visit, and/or making payment) does not in and of itself create a duty of care or create a patient-provider relationship.</li>
                                    <li>I understand that the provider will take responsibility for my care only after OBHS has received my consent and other required forms and the provider has reviewed my request for treatment, reviewed all my information, and then subsequently determined that I am a good candidate for the telehealth services.</li>
                                    <li>I understand that at any time during my care, my provider may determine that telehealth services only are no longer appropriate for me, refuse to take further responsibility for my care and refer me to appropriate in-person care.</li>
                                    <li>I understand that there may be a delay until the next business day (if falls on a weekend till Monday of that week), and at times longer before a provider reviews my request for treatment and any messages I send.</li>
                                    <li>I understand that I need to be responsive to ongoing requests for information from me, including but not limited to the completion of ongoing assessments about my symptoms, functioning, and/or side effects during my treatment, to remain under the care of this provider. If I am not responsive to these requests for information, I understand that I cannot be considered to be under the care of such a provider.</li>
                                    <li>I understand that my provider relies on the information that I provide and considers it to be accurate, true, and complete. Sometimes using telehealth means that the information transmitted to the provider may not be sufficient to allow for appropriate care or therapy decision-making by the provider. So, I need to provide sufficient information to my provider that will enhance the proper plan of care.</li>

                            <p>This document describes your protections against unexpected medical bills. It also asks if you’d like to give up those protections and pay more for out-of-network care.</p>
                            <p className="font-bold">IMPORTANT: You aren’t required to sign this form and shouldn’t sign if you didn’t have a choice of health care provider before scheduling care. You can choose to get care from a provider or facility in your health plan’s network, which may cost you less.</p>
                            <p>If you’d like assistance with this document, ask your provider or a patient advocate. Take a picture and/or keep a copy of this form for your records.</p>
                            <p>You’re getting this notice because this provider or facility isn’t in your health plan’s network and is considered out-of-network. This means the provider or facility doesn’t have an agreement with your plan to provide services. Getting care from this provider or facility will likely cost you more.</p>

                            <p>Ask your health care provider or patient advocate if you’re not sure if these protections apply to you.</p>

                                <li>Your health plan might not count any of the amount you pay towards your deductible and out-of-pocket limit. Contact your health plan for more information</li>

                            <p>Before deciding whether to sign this form, you can contact your health plan to find an in-network provider or facility.

                            <p>We understand that everyone has unplanned events that demand immediate attention and do require the cancellation of appointments. Please know that we schedule 45 minutes – 1-hour first appointment and up to 30 minutes follow-ups. When you cancel, it puts a large hole in our schedule.</p>
                            <p>I am authorizing Oasis Health Services, to charge my credit card in the event I fail to show up for a scheduled appointment or if I do not give notification of my inability to attend a scheduled appointment at least 24 business hours in advance. I am aware that weekends and holidays do not count as normal business hours (appointments on Monday must be canceled by the Friday before). I understand there will be a fee of $100.00 for each missed initial and follow-up appointment. I am aware that my insurance will not cover a missed appointment and that I am responsible for this fee. I understand and agree that my card may be charged without me being present. I will not dispute sessions that I have received or for sessions, I have canceled less than 24 business hours in advance.</p>
                            <p>If I arrive more than 15 minutes late to an appointment it will be considered a late cancellation/missed appointment.</p>

However, Oasis Health Services will submit a claim for you to any third party or insurance carrier with whom Oasis Health Services contracts. Although we offer a courtesy service to verify your insurance benefits, it is your responsibility to provide accurate information and also to contact your insurance plan to verify your benefits.</p>
                            <p>Your co-pay, co-insurance, and deductible (when applicable) are due and must be paid before my appointment time by cash, check, or card (credit/HSA/FSA). Invoices are sent before your appointment and you can pay by yourself from your patient portal. Statements are sent monthly. I agree that I will not dispute any charges to my credit card due to patient responsibilities, processed towards deductible or other balances.</p>
                            <p>Balances past due for 90 days will be sent to an outside collections agency.</p>
