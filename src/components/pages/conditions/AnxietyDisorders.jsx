      question: "How do I know if my anxiety is a disorder?",
      answer: "While everyone feels anxious sometimes, it may be a disorder if your worry feels excessive, is difficult to control, and interferes with your daily life, work, or relationships for an extended period (e.g., six months or more)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a panic attack and an anxiety attack?",
      answer: "Panic attacks are sudden, intense surges of fear that often occur without a clear trigger and peak within minutes. 'Anxiety attacks' isn't a clinical term, but it's often used to describe a period of high anxiety that can build up gradually in response to a stressor."
    },
    {
      question: "Can anxiety be cured?",
      answer: "While there may not be a 'cure,' anxiety disorders are highly treatable. Through therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, most people can learn to manage their symptoms effectively and lead full, productive lives."
