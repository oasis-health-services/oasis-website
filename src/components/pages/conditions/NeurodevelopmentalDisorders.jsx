      question: "Is it possible to have both ADHD and Autism?",
      answer: "Yes, it is very common for ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to co-occur. Our comprehensive assessments are designed to evaluate for both conditions and understand how they interact, which allows us to create a more effective and holistic treatment plan."
    },
    {
      question: "I'm an adult, can I still be diagnosed with ADHD or ASD?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Many adults live with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders. Our assessments are tailored for adults and include a thorough review of your childhood history and current challenges to provide an accurate diagnosis and guide treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support is available besides medication?",
      answer: "Treatment is about more than just medication. We emphasize skills-based therapies (like CBT for ADHD), coaching for executive functions (planning, organization), social skills training, and creating supportive environments at home, school, and work."
