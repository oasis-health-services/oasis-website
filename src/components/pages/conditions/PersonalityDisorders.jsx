      question: "Why is therapy the first-line treatment for personality disorders?",
      answer: "Personality disorders involve deeply ingrained patterns of thinking and behavior. Therapy, especially long-term and structured modalities like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), is essential for building self-awareness, learning new coping skills, improving emotional regulation, and fostering healthier relationship patterns. Medication can help with co-occurring symptoms but doesn't change the underlying personality structure."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a personality disorder diagnosis permanent?",
      answer: "While personality traits are stable, a diagnosis is not necessarily a life sentence. With commitment to therapy and hard work, individuals can learn to manage their symptoms so effectively that they may no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The goal is to reduce distress and improve functioning."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and OCD?",
      answer: "While they sound similar, they are different. OCD involves unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to relieve anxiety. OCPD is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control. People with OCPD often see their way of thinking as 'the right way,' whereas people with OCD are typically distressed by their obsessions."
