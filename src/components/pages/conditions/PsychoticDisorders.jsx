      question: "What is the difference between hallucinations and delusions?",
      answer: "A hallucination is a sensory experience that isn't real, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there. A delusion is a fixed, false belief that a person holds despite evidence to the contrary, such as believing they are being spied on or have special powers."
    },
    {
      question: "Is schizophrenia the same as 'split personality'?",
      answer: "No, this is a common misconception. Schizophrenia does not involve multiple personalities. That condition is now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, which is a completely different diagnosis. Schizophrenia involves a 'split' from reality."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'integrated care' mean for psychotic disorders?",
      answer: "Integrated care means we treat the whole person, not just the illness. It involves a combination of antipsychotic medication, individual and family therapy, psychoeducation to help everyone understand the condition, social skills training, and support for employment or education. This comprehensive approach leads to better long-term outcomes."

          <p>These are serious mental health conditions characterized by a disconnect from reality (psychosis). They can involve hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thought and behavior, as well as "negative" symptoms like a lack of motivation or emotional expression, leading to a significant decline in functioning.</p>

        <DetailSection title="Core Symptoms">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

          </ul>
        </DetailSection>

        <DetailSection title="How We Assess">
          <p>A comprehensive psychiatric and medical workup is essential. This includes lab tests (like CBC, CMP, TSH), a substance use screen, and a detailed risk review. Input from family is often critical. In some cases, neuroimaging may be considered to rule out other medical causes.</p>

        <DetailSection title="Treatment">
          <p>An integrated approach is key to managing psychotic disorders. Treatment includes:</p>
