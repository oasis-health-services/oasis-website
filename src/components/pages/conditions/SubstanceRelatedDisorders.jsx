      question: "What is 'harm reduction'?",
      answer: "Harm reduction is a practical and compassionate approach that aims to reduce the negative consequences associated with substance use. Instead of demanding immediate abstinence, it focuses on meeting people where they are and supporting any positive change. This can include strategies like reducing use, using more safely, and preventing overdose."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)?",
      answer: "MAT combines behavioral therapy and medications to treat substance use disorders. It's most commonly used for opioid use disorder (e.g., with buprenorphine) and alcohol use disorder (e.g., with naltrexone). The medications help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, which allows individuals to focus on their recovery in therapy."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be treated if I'm using multiple substances (polysubstance abuse)?",
      answer: "Yes. Our integrated approach is designed to handle complex cases, including polysubstance use. We prioritize safety risks first and then develop a stepwise plan to address each substance, carefully checking for medication interactions and combining therapies to support your overall recovery."

We use lab tests (like LFTs), Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) checks, and urine drug screens (UDS) as needed.
