      question: "What is the difference between PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder?",
      answer: "They have very similar symptoms, but the main difference is timing. Acute Stress Disorder is diagnosed when symptoms last from three days to one month after a traumatic event. If the symptoms persist for more than a month and cause significant distress or impairment, the diagnosis may be changed to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an Adjustment Disorder?",
      answer: "An Adjustment Disorder involves developing emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor (like a divorce, job loss, or serious illness). The distress is considered out of proportion to the severity of the stressor, and it significantly impairs social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'trauma-informed care' mean?",
      answer: "Trauma-informed care is an approach that assumes an individual is more likely than not to have a history of trauma. It recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role trauma may play in a person's life. This means we prioritize creating a physically and emotionally safe environment, fostering trust, and empowering you with choice and collaboration in your treatment."

          <p>These disorders develop following exposure to a traumatic or significantly stressful event. They involve a psychological response characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, negative changes in mood and thinking, and significant alterations in arousal and reactivity.</p>
        </DetailSection>

        <DetailSection title="Core Symptoms">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Intrusion:</strong> Recurrent, involuntary memories, flashbacks, or nightmares of the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, feelings, or external reminders of the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood:</strong> Persistent negative beliefs, distorted blame, and feelings of detachment or estrangement.</li>
            <li><strong>Arousal and Reactivity:</strong> Irritable behavior, angry outbursts, hypervigilance, and an exaggerated startle response.</li>
          </ul>
        </DetailSection>

        <DetailSection title="How We Assess">
          <p>We use validated screening tools like the PCL-5 for PTSD and assess for acute stress and adjustment disorders based on DSM-5 criteria. Our assessment carefully differentiates these conditions from grief, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or substance use, and includes a thorough review of risks and available supports.</p>
        </DetailSection>

        <DetailSection title="Treatment">
          <p>Our trauma-informed approach prioritizes safety and stabilization. Treatment includes:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Trauma-focused therapies are central to processing the event and reducing symptoms. We may also refer for specialized treatments like EMDR when appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Medication Management:</strong> Medications can be effective in managing symptoms like anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances associated with trauma.</li>
