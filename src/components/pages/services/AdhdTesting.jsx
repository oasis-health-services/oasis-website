    },
    {
      question: "Are stimulant medications safe?",
      answer: "When prescribed and monitored correctly by a qualified provider, stimulant medications are generally safe and effective for treating ADHD. We have a strict safety policy that includes reviewing your medical history, monitoring vital signs like blood pressure, and regular follow-ups to manage any potential side effects."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't want to take medication?",
      answer: "That's perfectly fine. Medication is just one tool. We also offer highly effective non-medication treatments, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for ADHD, skills coaching to improve organization and time management, and lifestyle interventions. We will work with you to create a plan that you are comfortable with."
