      question: "How do you decide which medication is right for me?",
      answer: "It's a collaborative process based on your diagnosis, symptoms, medical history, and personal preferences. We use evidence-based guidelines and may consider genetic testing (PGx) to inform choices. We'll discuss the potential benefits, risks, and side effects of each option with you."
    },
    {
      question: "How often will I need to have appointments?",
      answer: "When starting a new medication or adjusting a dose, we typically schedule follow-up appointments every 2-4 weeks. Once you are stable and doing well on a medication, these appointments can be spaced out to every 1-3 months."
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'measurement-based care'?",
      answer: "It means we use standardized, validated rating scales to track your symptoms and side effects over time. This gives us objective data to see how well a treatment is working and helps us make more informed decisions about your care plan together."
