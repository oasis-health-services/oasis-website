      question: "What is Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)?",
      answer: "TRD is generally defined as major depressive disorder that hasn't responded adequately to at least two different antidepressant treatments taken for a sufficient length of time at an adequate dose."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the common side effects of Spravato®?",
      answer: "The most common side effects include dissociation (feeling disconnected from yourself, your thoughts, and the world), dizziness, nausea, sleepiness, and increased blood pressure. These effects are temporary and are monitored by our clinical team during the required observation period after treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't I drive after a Spravato® treatment?",
      answer: "Because of its potential side effects, particularly sedation and dissociation, you must not drive or operate heavy machinery until the day after your treatment session, following a restful sleep. You will need to plan for a ride home from the clinic."
