      answer: "You don't have to figure that out on your own! During your initial assessment, your provider will discuss your goals and symptoms to recommend the therapeutic approach that best fits your needs. Our therapists are skilled in multiple modalities and often integrate techniques for a personalized experience."

      question: "How long does therapy take?",
      answer: "The duration of therapy is unique to each individual. Some people benefit from short-term, solution-focused therapy for a specific issue, while others engage in longer-term therapy to work on deeper patterns. We'll set goals together and regularly review your progress."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do therapy and medication management at the same time?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. For many conditions, the combination of therapy and medication is the most effective treatment. Our team provides integrated care, meaning your therapist and medication provider can coordinate to ensure your treatment plan is seamless and effective."
