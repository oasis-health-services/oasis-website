## Why Grounding Works

Anxiety often pulls us into the future — worrying about what might happen. Grounding brings your attention back to what's actually happening right now, in your body and environment. This shift can calm your nervous system and reduce overwhelm.

## Techniques to Try

### The 5-4-3-2-1 Method
This sensory awareness exercise is simple and effective:
- **5** things you can see
- **4** things you can touch
- **3** things you can hear
- **2** things you can smell
- **1** thing you can taste

Take your time with each sense. Really notice the details.

### Box Breathing
- Inhale slowly for 4 counts
- Hold your breath for 4 counts
- Exhale slowly for 4 counts
- Hold empty for 4 counts
- Repeat 4-8 times

### Physical Grounding
- Press your feet firmly into the floor
- Hold an ice cube or run cold water on your wrists
- Squeeze a stress ball or clench and release your fists
- Name the textures you can feel right now

### Mental Grounding
- Name 5 colors you can see around you
- Count backward from 100 by 7s
- Pick a category (animals, countries, songs) and name as many as you can
- Describe your surroundings in detail, as if to someone who can't see them

### Body Scan
Starting at your toes and moving up:
- Notice each part of your body
- Release any tension you find
- Breathe into areas that feel tight
- Take your time — there's no rush

## Tips for Success

- Practice when you're calm so these techniques become familiar
- Keep a few "go-to" techniques that work best for you
- Remember: the goal isn't to eliminate anxiety, but to manage it
- Be patient with yourself — like any skill, grounding gets easier with practice

## When Grounding Isn't Enough

If you find that anxiety is regularly overwhelming and grounding techniques aren't providing relief, it might be time to talk to a professional. Sometimes we need additional support, and that's okay.

These techniques are tools in your toolkit — not a replacement for professional care when needed.
