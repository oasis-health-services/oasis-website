## Before Your First Session

**Practical preparations:**
- Write down what brought you to therapy. You don't need a perfect explanation — even "I've been feeling off" is a valid starting point.
- Note any specific situations, patterns, or feelings you want to discuss.
- Have your insurance information ready if applicable.
- Arrive a few minutes early to settle in.

**Emotional preparation:**
- It's okay to feel anxious, skeptical, or uncertain.
- Remind yourself that your therapist sees people at all starting points.
- There's no "right way" to do therapy.

## What Actually Happens

**The first few minutes:** Your therapist will likely start by welcoming you and explaining how sessions work. They might discuss confidentiality and what to do in emergencies.

**Getting to know you:** Much of the first session is about understanding your background, what's bringing you in, and what you're hoping to get from therapy. This isn't an interrogation — it's a conversation.

**Questions you might hear:**
- "What brings you in today?"
- "Can you tell me about yourself?"
- "What are you hoping to work on?"
- "Is there anything you want me to know about you?"

**You don't have to share everything:** First sessions are about building a foundation. You can share at whatever pace feels comfortable.

## What You Might Feel

**During the session:** You might feel relieved to talk, nervous about opening up, unsure of what to say, or surprisingly comfortable. All of these are normal.

**After the session:** Some people feel lighter, others feel tired or stirred up. Processing can continue well after you leave the office.

## Building the Relationship

Therapy works best when you feel comfortable with your therapist. It's okay if it takes a few sessions to know if it's a good fit. You're allowed to:
- Ask questions about their approach
- Share what's working or not working
- Decide this person isn't the right fit and try someone else

## Remember

- There's no homework for your first session — just show up.
- Your feelings, whatever they are, are valid.
- Starting therapy is a brave step toward caring for yourself.

You don't have to have everything figured out. That's what the process is for.
