If you have ADHD, you've probably tried countless productivity systems that worked for a week and then fell apart. That's not a personal failure — it's because most advice isn't designed for how your brain works.

## Why Traditional Routines Often Fail

ADHD brains crave novelty and struggle with consistency. What feels motivating on Monday can feel impossibly boring by Friday. Add in time blindness, working memory challenges, and difficulty with transitions, and it's no wonder standard routines don't stick.

## Principles That Actually Help

### Make It Visible
Out of sight, out of mind is especially true with ADHD.
- Use visual reminders and lists in places you'll actually see
- Set multiple alarms and calendar alerts
- Keep important items in obvious locations

### Reduce Friction
Every extra step is a barrier. Make tasks as easy as possible.
- Lay out clothes the night before
- Keep medications by your toothbrush
- Prepare bags and materials ahead of time

### Build in Flexibility
Rigid routines often backfire. Instead:
- Have "good enough" versions of tasks for low-energy days
- Allow yourself to swap activities within timeblocks
- Focus on anchors (key activities) rather than minute-by-minute schedules

### Use Body Doubling
Having someone present (even virtually) can help you focus.
- Work alongside a friend
- Join virtual coworking sessions
- Even having a pet nearby can help

### Leverage Interest
ADHD brains are interest-driven, not importance-driven.
- Gamify boring tasks
- Pair unpleasant tasks with something enjoyable
- Find ways to make routine tasks novel

## Sample ADHD-Friendly Morning Routine

**Anchor 1: Wake up signal**
- Alarm across the room so you have to get up
- Immediately put on shoes (signals "active mode")

**Anchor 2: Basic needs**
- Bathroom, water, medication
- Keep these items together to reduce decisions

**Anchor 3: Movement**
- Even 5 minutes of stretching or walking
- Gets blood flowing and helps with focus

**Anchor 4: One priority task**
- Before checking phone or email
- Just one thing to create momentum

## When Things Fall Apart

They will. And that's okay.
- Notice without judgment
- Start again from wherever you are
- Adjust the routine if it's consistently not working
- Celebrate small wins

## Getting Support

If routines remain a major struggle despite trying these strategies, consider:
- Working with an ADHD coach
- Medication adjustments with your provider
- Therapy focused on executive function skills

Your brain works differently. That's not a flaw — it just means you need different strategies.
