Watching someone you love struggle with depression can be painful. You might feel helpless, frustrated, or unsure of what to say. Your support matters more than you might realize — but it's also important to understand what helps and what doesn't.

## Understanding What They're Experiencing

Depression isn't just feeling sad. It often includes:
- Persistent low mood that doesn't lift
- Loss of interest in things once enjoyed
- Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
- Sometimes, thoughts of death or suicide

Your loved one isn't choosing this, and they can't simply "snap out of it."

## How You Can Help

### Be Present
Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is simply be there. You don't need to fix anything or have perfect words.
- Sit with them, even in silence
- Let them know you're thinking of them
- Show up consistently, even when they push you away

### Listen Without Judgment
- Let them talk without trying to solve their problems
- Avoid minimizing their feelings ("It could be worse")
- Validate their experience ("That sounds really hard")

### Offer Practical Support
Depression makes everyday tasks feel overwhelming. Help with:
- Cooking a meal or bringing groceries
- Helping with household chores
- Accompanying them to appointments
- Just being there while they do tasks

### Encourage Professional Help
- Gently suggest therapy or seeing a doctor
- Offer to help find resources or make appointments
- Be patient — they may not be ready right away

## What to Avoid

- Don't try to force positivity or suggest they "just think happy thoughts"
- Avoid comparing their situation to others or saying they have "nothing to be sad about"
- Don't take their behavior personally — depression affects how people interact
- Resist the urge to fix everything — sometimes listening is enough

## Taking Care of Yourself

Supporting someone with depression can be emotionally draining. Remember:
- You can't pour from an empty cup
- Set boundaries when needed
- Seek your own support — therapy, friends, support groups
- You're not responsible for fixing them

## When to Seek Emergency Help

If your loved one mentions suicide or self-harm:
- Take it seriously
- Ask directly: "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
- Don't leave them alone if you're concerned about immediate safety
- Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to the nearest emergency room

Your presence and patience can be a lifeline. Even when it doesn't feel like it, you're making a difference.
