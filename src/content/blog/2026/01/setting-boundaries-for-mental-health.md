Boundaries are limits we set to protect our time, energy, and emotional wellbeing. They're not selfish — they're necessary for sustainable relationships and good mental health. Yet many of us struggle to set and maintain them.

## Why Boundaries Matter

Without boundaries:
- You may feel resentful, drained, or overwhelmed
- Others may unknowingly (or knowingly) take advantage
- Your needs consistently come last
- Relationships become unbalanced

With healthy boundaries:
- You have energy for what matters most
- Relationships are more honest and sustainable
- You model self-respect for others
- Your mental health improves

## Types of Boundaries

### Physical
Your personal space, body, and physical needs.
*Example: "I need you to knock before entering my room."*

### Emotional
Protecting your feelings and emotional energy.
*Example: "I can't be your only support person. I need you to also talk to a therapist."*

### Time
How you spend your hours and energy.
*Example: "I'm not available for work calls after 6pm."*

### Material
Your belongings and resources.
*Example: "I'm not comfortable lending money."*

### Digital
Your online presence and availability.
*Example: "I don't check work email on weekends."*

## How to Set Boundaries

### 1. Know Your Limits
Pay attention to feelings of resentment, exhaustion, or discomfort. These signal where boundaries are needed.

### 2. Be Clear and Direct
State boundaries simply without over-explaining or apologizing.
- Instead of: "I'm so sorry, I just really can't, I wish I could, but..."
- Try: "That doesn't work for me."

### 3. Use "I" Statements
Focus on your needs rather than criticizing others.
- "I need quiet time in the evenings" vs. "You're always bothering me"

### 4. Be Consistent
Boundaries only work if you maintain them. Inconsistency teaches others they can push back.

### 5. Accept Discomfort
Setting boundaries often feels uncomfortable at first. That doesn't mean you're doing it wrong.

## Common Challenges

### "But they'll be upset"
They might be. You can be kind and still firm. Their feelings about your boundary are their responsibility.

### "I feel guilty"
Guilt is common when you start setting boundaries, especially if you weren't taught this skill. It often fades with practice.

### "They don't respect my boundary"
You can't control others, but you can control your response. Boundaries may require consequences to be effective.

### "I don't know what I need"
Start noticing when you feel resentful, drained, or uncomfortable. These feelings point toward needed boundaries.

## Boundaries in Practice

**With family:** "I love you and I'm not willing to discuss my weight/relationship/career choices."

**At work:** "I can take on this project if we move the deadline on the other one. Which is the priority?"

**With friends:** "I care about you, and I don't have capacity to support you through this right now. Can we find other resources?"

**With yourself:** "I'm going to bed at 10pm even if I haven't finished everything."

## Remember

Boundaries are an act of self-respect. They create the conditions for you to show up as your best self in relationships and in life
