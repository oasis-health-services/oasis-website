  "html": "<p><strong>Why your mind and body react the way they do, and how you can move forward</strong></p><p>Trauma isn’t defined by the event itself. It’s defined by how your nervous system had to cope with something overwhelming, frightening, or deeply unsafe. Afterward, your body holds on to that experience in ways you can feel long after the moment is over.</p><p>For many people, trauma symptoms show up months or even years later. Flashbacks, anxiety, irritability, numbness, emotional shutdown, trouble sleeping, or feeling constantly “on guard” are all common responses. None of these reactions mean something is wrong with you. They mean your system survived something hard, and it hasn’t fully returned to safety yet.</p><hr><h3 id=\"why-trauma-lives-in-the-body\"><strong>Why Trauma Lives in the Body</strong></h3><p>Trauma affects more than memory. It impacts how your nervous system regulates itself.</p><ul><li><strong>Fight-or-flight stays stuck “on.”</strong> Your body doesn’t trust that the danger is gone.</li><li><strong>Sleep becomes shallow or disrupted.</strong> Your system stays alert, even at night.</li><li><strong>Emotions feel unpredictable.</strong> You may swing between numbness and overwhelm.</li><li><strong>Physical symptoms appear.</strong> Tension, headaches, stomach issues, or chronic pain can emerge.</li></ul><p>This is why trauma recovery isn’t just emotional work, it’s also physical healing.</p><hr><blockquote><strong>Callout:</strong> Trauma isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s a sign you had to adapt quickly to survive something you never should’ve faced.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"how-oasis-supports-trauma-recovery\"><strong>How Oasis Supports Trauma Recovery</strong></h3><p>At <strong>Oasis Health Services</strong>, trauma care is built on safety, compassion, and pace.
