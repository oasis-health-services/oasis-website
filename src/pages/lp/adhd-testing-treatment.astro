const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is it possible to have both ADHD and Autism?",
    answer: "Yes, ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently co-occur. Many individuals have both conditions, and our comprehensive assessment is designed to identify all neurodevelopmental differences to create the most effective treatment plan."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm an adult, can I still be diagnosed with ADHD?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many adults weren't diagnosed as children, especially women and those with primarily inattentive symptoms. ADHD is a lifelong condition, and getting a proper diagnosis at any age can be life-changing for understanding yourself and accessing effective treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support is available besides medication?",
    answer: "We offer a multi-faceted approach including cognitive behavioral therapy for ADHD, skills coaching for organization and time management, and strategies for managing common challenges. Many patients benefit from a combination of medication and these non-medication approaches."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the ADHD assessment take?",
    answer: "The comprehensive assessment typically involves an initial screening, followed by a detailed clinical interview (60-90 minutes), and completion of standardized rating scales. The entire process usually takes 1-2 appointments to complete thoroughly."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you prescribe stimulant medications?",
    answer: "When clinically appropriate, we do prescribe stimulant medications as they are highly effective for many people with ADHD. We also offer non-stimulant alternatives. All prescriptions follow strict safety protocols with regular monitoring."
