const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)?",
    answer: "Treatment-resistant depression is diagnosed when a person has not adequately responded to at least two different antidepressant medications taken at adequate doses for sufficient duration. Spravato offers a new mechanism of action that can help when traditional antidepressants haven't worked."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the common side effects of Spravato?",
    answer: "The most common side effects include dissociation (feeling disconnected), dizziness, nausea, sedation, vertigo, and increased blood pressure. These effects typically peak within 40 minutes and resolve within 2 hours, which is why we monitor you throughout your visit."
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I drive after a Spravato treatment?",
    answer: "Spravato can cause temporary dissociation, sedation, and impaired coordination. For your safety, you cannot drive or operate heavy machinery until the day after your treatment. Please arrange for transportation home after each session."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Spravato different from other treatments?",
    answer: "Spravato works on the glutamate system rather than the serotonin system targeted by most antidepressants. This different mechanism can provide relief for patients who haven't responded to traditional medications, often with faster-acting results."
  },
  {
    question: "Will insurance cover Spravato treatment?",
    answer: "Many insurance plans cover Spravato for treatment-resistant depression. Our team will work with your insurance to determine coverage and obtain any necessary prior authorizations before starting treatment."
